# http.port=9000
#
# By default the server listen for HTTP on the wilcard address.
# You can restrict this.
# http.address=127.0.0.1
#
# Use this if you don't host your Play application at the root of the domain
# you're serving it from. This parameter has no effect when deployed as a
# war, because the path will be handled by the application server.
# http.path=/

# JVM configuration
# ~~~~~
# Define which port is used by JPDA when application is in debug mode (default is set to 8000)
# jpda.port=8000
#
# Java source level => 1.5, 1.6 or 1.7 (experimental)

# application.log.system.out=off

# HTTP Response headers control for static files

# Set the default max-age, telling the user's browser how long it should cache the page.
# Default is 3600 (one hour). Set it to 0 to send no-cache.
# This is only read in prod mode, in dev mode the cache is disabled.
# http.cacheControl=3600

# If enabled, Play will generate entity tags automatically and send a 304 when needed.
# Default is true, set it to false to deactivate use of entity tags.
# http.useETag=true

# Custom mime types
# mimetype.xpi=application/x-xpinstall

# WS configuration

# If you need to set proxy params for WS requests
# http.proxyHost = localhost
# http.proxyPort = 3128
# http.proxyUser = jojo

# Url-resolving in Jobs

# Size of the Jobs pool
# play.jobs.pool=10

# Execution pool
# ~~~~~
# Default to 1 thread in DEV mode or (nb processors + 1) threads in PROD mode.
# Try to keep a low as possible. 1 thread will serialize all requests (very useful for debugging purpose)
# play.pool=3

# Open file from errors pages
# ~~~~~
# If your text editor supports opening files by URL, Play! will
# dynamically link error pages to files 
#

# play.editor=txmt://open?url=file://%s&line=%s
